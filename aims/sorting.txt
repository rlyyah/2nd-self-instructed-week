    1.What is the difference between the list.sort() method and sorted() function?
        We can call sort() method only on lists, but we can use sorted() function on other
        objects like dictionaries or tulpes. Sort is a little bit faster but has less usage
    2.How to sort in reverse (descending) order?
        sort(reverse=True), sorted(obj, reverse=True)
    3.How will Python sort a list of strings, such as ['this', 'is', 'a', 'sentence']? (Try it out!)
        In alphabetical order of every element
    4.How will Python sort a list of tuples, such as [(2, 'World'), (1, 'Hello')]?
        It will sort by the first element of every tuple
    5.How to sort a list of strings by length (from shortest to longest string)?
        sorted(obj, key=lambda element: len(element))
    6.How to sort a list of tuples by the second element?
        sorted(tuple_obj, key=lambda element: element[2])
        sorted(student_tuples, key=itemgetter(2))
        sorted(student_objects, key=attrgetter('name_of_2nd_ele'))
    7.What is a lambda expression?
    8.What does it mean that Python sorting is stable?
